# Go Katas

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of coding katas and their solutions implemented in Go (Golang). Each kata is a small programming challenge that helps in honing your Go programming skills through practice and repetition. The solutions are structured to demonstrate idiomatic Go programming practices and efficient algorithmic solutions.

## Repository Structure

Each directory within this repository represents a different kata. Within each directory, you will find at least two files:
- `solution.go`: This file contains the Go code implementing the solution to the kata.
- `solution_test.go`: This file contains tests for the solution using Go's built-in testing framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the solutions in this repository, you will need:
- Go installed on your machine. Go can be downloaded and installed from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Cloning the Repository

To get started with these katas, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-katas.git
cd go-katas

```
### Running the Solutions

To run a specific solution, navigate to the directory of the kata and run the Go file. For example:

```bash

cd path/to/kata
go run solution.go

```
### Running the Tests

To execute the tests for a specific solution, use the following command:

```bash

go test -v
```
This command will run the tests associated with the kata's solution, providing verbose output that shows which tests have passed and which have failed.

### Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome, especially in the form of additional katas and solutions, or improvements to existing solutions.

If you wish to contribute:

    - Fork the repository.
    - Create a new branch for your contribution (git checkout -b new-kata).
    - Add your kata and solution.
    - Push the changes to your fork (git push origin new-kata).
    - Submit a pull request.

Please ensure your code adheres to clean code principles and is well-commented.
